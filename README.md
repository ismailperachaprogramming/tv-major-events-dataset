## Methodology & Rules

- Only **one primary event per episode** is logged.
- Events must be **explicit and on-screen**; off-screen or ambiguous deaths are excluded.
- Priority rules determine which event is recorded when multiple occur.
- `is_event = 0` requires `event_type` and `event_detail` to be blank.
- Episode indexing is unique within each show.
- Event types are restricted to the controlled vocabulary table.
